    <h2>A southern classic born from hard times</h2>
        <p>This hearty dish hails from my father's mother and her family. At first glance many may assume we're just delving into the classic of a sloppy joe, but fear not, this recipe is far simpler and allows good ingredients to shine! </p>
        <p>With ground beef, onions and a few simple spices, this recipe is sure to please.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p><ul>
                <li>1 pound of 90/20 Ground Beef</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon Kosher Salt, with more to taste</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, with more to taste</li>
                <li>One small yellow onion, finely diced</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>A quarter cup of water</li>
                <li>and my own contribution to this meaty mess, one small pinch of MSG</li>



                
            </ul></p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Begin by bringing a medium sized skillet or cast iron pan to medium heat</li>
                <li>Add ground beef and diced onions and cook until meat is brown and the onions have gone clear</li>
                <li>Add all of the above spices</li>
                <li>Add water and lit simmer</li>
                <li>Once the water has cooked off, taste your meat and adjust salt/pepper according to your personal likings</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol></p>
        <h4>Tips!</h4>
        <p> Adding a little water after the meat is browned and the onions are translucent gives the flavors time to meld as the water cooks off, this step isn't required but suggested.</p>
