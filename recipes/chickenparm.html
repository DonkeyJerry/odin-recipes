            <li>Half cup of flour</li>

        </ul>
    <h4>Items you may need</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A deep frying pan or deep cast iron pan</li>
            <li>A meat prob-style thermometer</li>
            <li>3 shallow bowls or baking pans for dredging</li>
            <li>Wire rack for cooling</li>
            <li>1 small sauce pan or microwave safe bowl to heat marinara</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by creating a workstation for yourself by arranging the three shallow bowls with your flour, 2 beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs in each.</li>
            <li>Be sure to add your seasonings to the flour, while saving a small amount of salt to put on the chicken after frying.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oil, in your pan of choice to 350 degrees (F).</li>
            <li>Heat up your marinara of choice in a small sauce pan out of the way.</li>
            <li>Preheat your ovens broil function as high as it will go.</li>
            <li>Take your chicken cutlet(s) and begin the dredging process by first dipping them in the flour with one hand, then egg with the other hand, being sure to cover completely. Then, with the first hand that used the flour, take the eggy chicken and place it in the bread crumbs, making sure to coat completely.</li>
            <li>Place both of the chicken breasts in the fridge for a few minutes, to let the mixture firm up.</li>
            <li>After 5-10 minutes, remove chicken from fridge and place them in the hot oil, facing away from you as to not splash yourself.</li>
            <li>Fry approximately 5-10 minutes per side until your instant read thermometer reads 360 degrees.</li>
            <li>Once internal temp. is reached, place on wire for cooling and immediately sprinkle with salt.</li>
            <li>Place a small amount of your marinara on a plate and adorn it with a chicken cutlet, then apply another spoonful or two of marinara to the top.</li>
            <li>Finally, top with a generous portion of mozzarella and place in broiler, being sure to keep a close eye and remove when bubble begin to form with a golden brown top.</li>
        </ol>
