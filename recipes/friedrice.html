    <p>This recipe is one that I have adapted from several different sources and establishments that I've frequented, it is by no means a creation of my own but rather a combination of many influences.</p>
    <p>Fried can be an extremely easy thing to make provided you have a few tools and most importantly, rice, preferably, rice from yesterday's dinner.</p>
